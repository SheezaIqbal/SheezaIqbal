>A square garden is to be divided into 4 smaller square plots by two paths that are 1 meter wide and cross each other at right angles. The paths run North-South and East-West, splitting the garden symmetrically. If the total area occupied by the paths is 36 square meters, find the side length of the original square garden.



The above is a prompt that includes questions related to "ratio and proportion" as well as "geometry."

Find y if y=4x^3+3x^2-2x+1
Model A
To find the derivative of y with respect to x, we'll use the power rule of differentiation, which states that if y = x^n, then y' = nx^(n-1).

Here's the step-by-step process:

Differentiate the first term: 4x^3
Using the power rule, we get: d(4x^3)/dx = 4(3)x^(3-1) = 12x^2

Differentiate the second term: 3x^2
Using the power rule, we get: d(3x^2)/dx = 3(2)x^(2-1) = 6x

Differentiate the third term: -2x
Using the power rule, we get: d(-2x)/dx = -2(1)x^(1-1) = -2

Differentiate the fourth term: 1
The derivative of a constant is 0, so: d(1)/dx = 0

Now, combine the results: y' = 12x^2 + 6x - 2

So, the derivative of y with respect to x is y' = 12x^2 + 6x - 2.
